                Google, LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related <br>
                services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud
                computing,<br>
                software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Five technology companies in the U.S.<br>
                information technology industry, alongside Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.[9][10][11]<br>

                Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at<br>
                Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56<br>
                percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a<br>
                California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated
                in<br>
                Delaware on October 22, 2002.[12] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004,
                and<br>
                Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August
                2015,<br>
                Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc.
                Google<br>
                is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's
                Internet<br>
                interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of<br>
                Alphabet.<br>

                The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and<br>
                partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for
                work<br>
                and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time<br>
                management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo,<br>
                Hangouts, Chat, and Meet), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google
                Maps,<br>
                Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube),
                blog<br>
                publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Google Jamboard), and photo organizing and
                editing<br>
                (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the
                Google<br>
                Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser.
                Google<br>
                has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics<br>
                manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in<br>
                October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh<br>
                wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with
                becoming<br>
                an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).[13]<br>

                Google.com is the most visited website in the world.[14] Several other Google services also figure
                in<br>
                the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger. Google was the most valuable brand
                in<br>
                the world in 2017 (surpassed by Amazon),[15] but has received significant criticism involving issues<br>
                such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality.<br>

                On Fortune magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and<br>
                2012,[214][215][216] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[217][218] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be
                the<br>
                world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent<br>
                attraction index.[219] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as "you can make money<br>
                without doing evil," "you can be serious without a suit," and "work should be challenging and the<br>
                challenge should be fun."[220]<br>

                As of December 2018, Google had 98,771 employees.[8] Google's 2017 diversity report states that 31<br>
                percent of its workforce are women and 69 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being<br>
                predominantly white (56%) and Asian (35%).[221] Within tech roles, however, 20 percent were women;
                and<br>
                25 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[221]<br>

                Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six
                hierarchies<br>
                based on experience and can range "from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and<br>
                experienced engineers at level six."[222] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as<br>
                Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on
                projects<br>
                that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense
                originated<br>
                from these independent endeavors.[223] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's<br>
                Vice-President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new<br>
                product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[224]<br>

                In 2005, articles in The New York Times[225] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost
                its<br>
                anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[226][227][228] In an effort to maintain the company's unique<br>
                culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the
                culture<br>
                and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[229] Google has
                also<br>
                faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[230][231] In 2013, a class action
                against<br>
                several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements<br>
                which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[232] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018,<br>
                multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their<br>
                “conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or […] Caucasian or Asian race”<br>

                Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both
                PhD<br>
                students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.[16] The project initially involved an<br>
                unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code
                for<br>
                the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a<br>
                company;[17][18] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage
                in<br>
                2006.[19][20]<br>

                While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared
                on<br>
                the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[21]
                They<br>
                called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the<br>
                importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[22][23] Page told his ideas to
                Hassan,<br>
                who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[17]<br>

                Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked
                backlinks<br>
                to estimate the importance of a site.[24][25][26] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by
                Page<br>
                and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later<br>
                co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the
                initial<br>
                prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were
                also<br>
                cited as contributors to the project.[27] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and<br>
                site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's<br>
                PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the<br>
                Chinese search engine Baidu.[28][29][30]<br>

                Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a
                misspelling<br>
                of the word "googol",[31][32] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that
                the<br>
                search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[33]<br>

                Google's homepage in 1998<br>
                Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in<br>
                HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[34]<br>
                The domain name www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997,[35] and the company was<br>
                incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[16]) in
                Menlo<br>
                Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first<br>
                employee.[16][36][37]<br>

                Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,<br>
                co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[38] Google
                received<br>
                money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University<br>
                computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[39] Between these initial<br>
                investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to<br>
                open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[40]<br>

                After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[39] a new $25
                million<br>
                round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[41] with major investors including the venture
                capital<br>
                firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.<br>
