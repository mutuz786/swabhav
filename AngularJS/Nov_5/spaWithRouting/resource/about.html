        Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both
        PhD<br>
        students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.[16] The project initially involved an<br>
        unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code
        for<br>
        the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a<br>
        company;[17][18] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage
        in<br>
        2006.[19][20]<br>

        While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared
        on<br>
        the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[21]
        They<br>
        called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the<br>
        importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[22][23] Page told his ideas to
        Hassan,<br>
        who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[17]<br>

        Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked
        backlinks<br>
        to estimate the importance of a site.[24][25][26] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by
        Page<br>
        and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later<br>
        co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the
        initial<br>
        prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were
        also<br>
        cited as contributors to the project.[27] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and<br>
        site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's<br>
        PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the<br>
        Chinese search engine Baidu.[28][29][30]<br>

        Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a
        misspelling<br>
        of the word "googol",[31][32] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that
        the<br>
        search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[33]<br>

        Google's homepage in 1998<br>
        Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in<br>
        HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[34]<br>
        The domain name www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997,[35] and the company was<br>
        incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[16]) in
        Menlo<br>
        Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first<br>
        employee.[16][36][37]<br>

        Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,<br>
        co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[38] Google
        received<br>
        money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University<br>
        computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[39] Between these initial<br>
        investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to<br>
        open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[40]<br>

        After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[39] a new $25
        million<br>
        round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[41] with major investors including the venture
        capital<br>
        firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.<br>
