        Google, LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related <br>
        services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud
        computing,<br>
        software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Five technology companies in the U.S.<br>
        information technology industry, alongside Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.[9][10][11]<br>

        Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at<br>
        Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56<br>
        percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a<br>
        California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated
        in<br>
        Delaware on October 22, 2002.[12] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004,
        and<br>
        Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August
        2015,<br>
        Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc.
        Google<br>
        is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's
        Internet<br>
        interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of<br>
        Alphabet.<br>

        The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and<br>
        partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for
        work<br>
        and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time<br>
        management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo,<br>
        Hangouts, Chat, and Meet), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google
        Maps,<br>
        Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube),
        blog<br>
        publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Google Jamboard), and photo organizing and
        editing<br>
        (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the
        Google<br>
        Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser.
        Google<br>
        has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics<br>
        manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in<br>
        October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh<br>
        wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with
        becoming<br>
        an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).[13]<br>

        Google.com is the most visited website in the world.[14] Several other Google services also figure
        in<br>
        the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger. Google was the most valuable brand
        in<br>
        the world in 2017 (surpassed by Amazon),[15] but has received significant criticism involving issues<br>
        such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality.<br>
