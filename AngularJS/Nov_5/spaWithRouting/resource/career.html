        On Fortune magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and<br>
        2012,[214][215][216] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[217][218] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be
        the<br>
        world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent<br>
        attraction index.[219] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as "you can make money<br>
        without doing evil," "you can be serious without a suit," and "work should be challenging and the<br>
        challenge should be fun."[220]<br>

        As of December 2018, Google had 98,771 employees.[8] Google's 2017 diversity report states that 31<br>
        percent of its workforce are women and 69 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being<br>
        predominantly white (56%) and Asian (35%).[221] Within tech roles, however, 20 percent were women;
        and<br>
        25 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[221]<br>

        Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six
        hierarchies<br>
        based on experience and can range "from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and<br>
        experienced engineers at level six."[222] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as<br>
        Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on
        projects<br>
        that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense
        originated<br>
        from these independent endeavors.[223] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's<br>
        Vice-President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new<br>
        product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[224]<br>

        In 2005, articles in The New York Times[225] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost
        its<br>
        anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[226][227][228] In an effort to maintain the company's unique<br>
        culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the
        culture<br>
        and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[229] Google has
        also<br>
        faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[230][231] In 2013, a class action
        against<br>
        several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements<br>
        which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[232] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018,<br>
        multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their<br>
        “conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or […] Caucasian or Asian race”<br>
